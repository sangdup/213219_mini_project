## Overview
This program calculates the value of a definite integral using various numerical integration methods such as the Trapezoidal Rule, Simpson's Rule, corrected Trapezoidal Rule, and corrected Simpson's Rule.

## Features
- It supports calculation of definite integrals over a specified interval.
- Allows the user to specify the desired accuracy for the integral calculation.
- Implements both basic and corrected versions of the Trapezoidal Rule and Simpson's Rule.
- Continuously refines the integral estimate until the desired accuracy is achieved.
- Allows the user to change the function being integrated my modifying the 'f' funcion in the file.
